# pico-xmas
giles' projects for the RaspberryPi Pico from the XMas Advent Calendar 2022.

See https://thepihut.com/pages/advent for details of the projects.

## Setup
Note to make this work on linux requires:
```bash
sudo adduser <your_user_name> dialout
```

Followed by a reboot (logout is not enough)

## Recommended developer tools
For this project I have used vscode with this extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go.

This gives quite a nice experience compared to Thonny (see below).
Note that some of the functions require you hit ctrl-shift-P and type 'pico'
