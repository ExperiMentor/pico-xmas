# pico-xmas
giles' projects for the RaspberryPi Pico from the XMas Advent Calendar

See https://thepihut.com/pages/advent

For these I have used vscode with this extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go.

Note to make this work on linux requires:
```bash
sudo adduser <your_user_name> dialout
```

Followed by a reboot (logout is not enough)
